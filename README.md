# Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of both simple and multiple linear regression models to predict housing prices using a real estate dataset. It uses Python libraries scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib for data processing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset `Housing.csv` contains features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and various categorical features like main road access, guest room, basement, and furnishing status. These categorical variables are converted to numerical values for modeling.

## Objectives
- Understand and apply simple linear regression using a single feature (area) to predict price.
- Build and evaluate a multiple linear regression model using all available predictors.
- Evaluate models with metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² score.
- Visualize regression line for simple linear regression.
- Interpret coefficients from multiple linear regression to understand feature influence.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
